# Webscraping-Project---Dark-Souls-Enemies
In this project we are going to retrieving data from Dark Souls Remastered Wiki Page, particularly from the Enemies' Section. We're going to be taking each enemie's name, Stats (HP, Physical Defense, Slash Defense, Poison Resistance, Bleed Resistance, etc..), as well as the multiple variations of each one in order to create a DataFrame containing all this info.!
